# Vending machine app

This is my Programming 3 final project to showcase our skills in WPF as we just learned it that semester

## About the app

We made a vending machine application, it will have the essential add-to-cart and checkout features, but it will also be able to select the number of items you want to take and display the total. It will additionally remove an item from the cart along with its quantity.

## Contribution
I mostly worked on the backend, but had to make or edit a couple of pages of the frontend

## Future Work
In the future, the optimization of the clear cart button will be important since the code is quite loose. Implementing remove from cart to put the product back in its correct spot if it is empty/ has no stock available. An auto restock could be implemented when the stock is empty. Adding multi selection to the remove from cart button could let the user delete multiple items without having to clear the entire cart and reducing the growth rate of the ClearCart would be good. We should improve the UI design in general. Improve the use of OOP pillars in the class implementation.
